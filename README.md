# 🍊 Orange ML Classification Project

A machine learning classification project built using [Orange Data Mining](https://orangedatamining.com/), a visual programming tool for data analysis and machine learning workflows.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning classification techniques using Orange's visual workflow interface, with a focus on:
- **Data Prediction**: Building predictive models using classification algorithms
- **Image Preprocessing**: Processing and preparing image data for machine learning tasks. The project includes complete workflows, datasets, and comprehensive documentation of the analysis process.
